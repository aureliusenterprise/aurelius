# Statistics

This module includes common statistical functions. 

Since some statistical functions can be quite expensive to perform as datasets grow in size, and to keep the general interface consistent, all statistics functions should return a `Promise`. 

# Nx

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test statistics` to execute the unit tests.
