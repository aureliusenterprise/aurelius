# Metamodel

The Metamodel module defines several languages implementing the `Language` interface. A language consists of elements and relationships. Currently, the following languages are available:

- `Archimate 3.0`

Use the `toHumanReadableNames()` function on the elements and relationships of any `Language` to reference concepts by name rather than ID.
