### Data domains

Since domains often correspond to departments, it provides a shopping list of common departments found in most organisations.

Users can pick the deparments of their organisation from the shopping list.
Using the search bar, users can look for the specific entries they want to add to the selection.
If an entry is missing from the suggestions, it is possible to add a new entry by clicking the button at the bottom of the panel.
It is also possible to edit the names of suggested entries, to fit with the names used in the organisation.

By clicking continue, the selection is saved and the wizard moves to the next step.
