# DetailsCardComponent

This is a generic card component which can be used to display various properties of a data governance entity in a compact format.
These cards are intended to be used in a search context.

The `DetailsCardComponent` provides basic functionality for all details cards.
Each entity type has its own implementation that controls the card content.
Please view the stories for a particular entity type for examples.

## Dependencies

The `DetailsCardComponent` requires type definitions to be available from the `SuperTypesInformationService` in order to resolve the card templates for a particular entity type.

## Behaviour

The `DetailsCardComponent` expects a search result representing an atlas entity as initial input.
Atfter receiving a new search result as input, the atlas entity corresponding to the search result is retrieved from Atlas.
In addition, any related data governance quality non-compliancies are retrieved from the data governance quality database.

The sequence diagram below describes the overall behaviour of the `DetailsCardComponent`.

    sequenceDiagram
    participant Atlas
    participant App Search
    participant Card
    participant Governance Quality
    Atlas -->> Card: Type definitions
    App Search -->> Card: Search result
    par
        Card ->> Atlas: Entity details
        Atlas -->> Card: Atlas entity
    and
        Card ->> Governance Quality: Non-compliance
        Governance Quality -->> Card: Search results
    end
  `}
/>

When all required data is retrieved from the various sources, the `DetailsCardComponent` can resolve the details card template corresponding to the current entity type.
