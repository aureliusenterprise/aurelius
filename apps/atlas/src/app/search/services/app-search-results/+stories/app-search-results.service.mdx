# AppSearchResultsService

The `AppSearchResultsService` allows for the execution of search queries and retrieval of search results from an app search engine.
For large sets of results, it also provides automatic paging.

## Dependencies

The `AppSearchResultsService` depends on a `SearchService` to define the search query.
Further, it depends on an `AppSearchService` to direct queries to the appropriate search engine.

## State

The `AppSearchResultsService` implementes `BasicStore` and manages the following properties:

| Property        | Description                                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `isLoadingPage` | Whether or not a page is currently being loaded. |
| `pageSize`      | The maximum size of a page of search results.    |

## Generics

The `AppSearchResultsService` declares the following generic types:

| Generic type | Description                                               |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `T`          | The shape of the document in app search.                  |
| `P`          | The fields of the document included in the search result. |

## Behaviour

The sections below explain the behaviour of the `AppSearchResultsService`.

### Query updated

Whenever the search query is updated, the `AppSearchResultsService` automatically retrieves the first page of search results.

<Mermaid
  chart={`
  sequenceDiagram
      SearchService ->> AppSearchResultsService: Query updated
      activate AppSearchResultsService
      AppSearchResultsService ->> AppSearchService: Get first page
      AppSearchService -->> AppSearchResultsService: First results page
      deactivate AppSearchResultsService
  `}
/>

### Next page

The loading of the next page is triggered by calling the `nextPage` method.
Please see the diagram below.

<Mermaid
  chart={`
  sequenceDiagram
      Consumer ->> AppSearchResultsService: nextPage()
      activate AppSearchResultsService
      AppSearchResultsService ->> AppSearchService: Get next page
      AppSearchService -->> AppSearchResultsService: Next results page
      deactivate AppSearchResultsService
  `}
/>

## Result streams

There are two streams of search results available.

### `results$`

The `results$` stream collects all search results for the currently loaded pages.
When a new page is retrieved, it is joined with the previous results and emitted as a flat list.

The list of search results is reset whenever the search query changes.

### `allResults$`

This `allResults$` stream automatically collects all available search results pages and emits all pages as a flat list.

Use this stream when you want to trigger the loading of next pages automatically instead of incrementally.

<Mermaid
  chart={`
  sequenceDiagram
    SearchService ->> AppSearchResultsService: Query updated
    activate AppSearchResultsService
    AppSearchResultsService ->> AppSearchService: Get first page
    AppSearchService -->> AppSearchResultsService: First results page
    loop More pages available
        AppSearchResultsService ->> AppSearchService: Get next page
        AppSearchService -->> AppSearchResultsService: Next results page
    end
    deactivate AppSearchResultsService
  `}
/>
